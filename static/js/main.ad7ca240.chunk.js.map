ECPs can prevent up to 95% unwanted pregnancies when taken within 3 days after intercourse. ECPs prevent pregnancy by preventing or delaying ovulation and they do not induce an abortion. In India, ECPs were introduced in 2002 by the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and was made an over the counter drug in 2005. However, there is an apparent misconception in the state of Tamil Nadu which has led to a shadow ban on ECPs.\r\n\r\n2.\tThe aforementioned shadow ban on ECPs is not a legal ban imposed by the state authorities, however, it is a moral ban imposed on pharmacies to abstain from the sale of ECPs. I submit that ECPs are easily available in all other states in India, except in Tamil Nadu. This issue has been brought to the attention of the government authorities through various campaigns on mainstream media as well as social media. Among the most popular articles, an article from 2006 elucidates how nearly Rs. 50 lakhs worth emergency contraceptive pills were seized from pharmacies in Chennai. On further analysis, it was stated that the ECPs were wrongly seized despite their legal availability as ECPs were mistaken for abortion pills at the time. This issue has been brought to light time and again, however, ECPs are not yet sold in pharmacies in Tamil Nadu. The pharmacies predominantly state that they “are out of stock” or that they “do not sell such drugs”.\r\n\r\n3.\tIt is my humble submission that ECPs are not abortion pills. The ECPs will not induce an abortion in a woman who is already pregnant, nor will it affect the developing pre-embryo or embryo. ECPs merely help prevent unwanted pregnancies and aid women in preventing abortions which are not only harmful to their health but also expensive. I submit that most women in rural areas lack access to basic health care facilities and do not have adequate financial aid for abortion. ECPs on the other hand, are taken within 3 days of having unprotected intercourse and the pill prevents pregnancy by blocking or delaying ovulation in a cost effective manner. It is therefore imperative to state that ECPs cannot terminate pregnancy.   \r\n\r\n4.\tI submit that India is the second most over populated nation and in Chennai for instance, surveys record the sale of ECPs were negligible as sale of ECP in Tamil Nadu is “banned”. Furthermore, access to ECPs is lower in smaller towns and in the rural areas wherein women are completely denied the opportunity to prevent unwanted pregnancies. The ECPs are therefore a need of the hour to not only aid women with adequate infrastructure to prevent unwanted pregnancies, but also for the nation to prevent over population.  \r\n\r\n5.\tI submit that the inability of millions of women in the Tamil Nadu to access ECPs during the last 14 years is slated to have an adverse impact on reproductive health indicators, maternal and infant mortality. It has also deprived millions of women of their choice of contraception. Furthermore, the unavailability of ECPs may lead to unwanted pregnancies which some women may choose to terminate. However, in case of termination, it is reliably learnt that due to limited availability of surgical abortion services, particularly in rural areas, and barriers on availability of medical abortion drugs at chemists, many women are forced to resort to unsafe providers, risking their health and lives and more so during the lockdown period.\r\n\r\n6.\tI submit that a mere notification clarifying the legality of ECPs would not be sufficient for the state of Tamil Nadu. It appears that the knowledge of pharmacists regarding the use of ECPs is inadequate and not up-to-date in order to counsel and advise the customers on the sale of ECPs. This is clearly evident from the responses of the pharmacists in various articles and testimonials wherein they have stated that they do not sell such drugs referring to abortion pills.
